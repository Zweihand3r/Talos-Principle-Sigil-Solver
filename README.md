# Talos-Principle-Sigil-Solver

A little something to solve the sigil puzzles in the game 'Talos Priciple'. Crashes when more than 9 sigils are fed into the solver. So in theory this is kinda useless as it can only solve the simple puzzles.

Needs a way to permute a string of more than 9 characters without getting a 'maximum stack call size exceeded' to solve the crash.

This video shows what this thing is all about. This program finds a way to fit all the tetris like blocks in the grid such that all the grid squares are occupied:
